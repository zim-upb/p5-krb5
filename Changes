Revision history for Perl extension Authen-Krb5.

1.906 2025-04-07T17:24:02Z
 - Make init_context() really return the context as documented. We also
   make it safe to call init_context() several times in case one wants
   to access the context object later.
   (Ansgar Burchardt <ansgar@43-1.org>)
 - Remove compiler errors about implicit function declarations which
   have flipped from warnings to errors since c compiler c99.
   (Christopher Odenbach)
 - Remove compiler errors about incompatible pointers. The SvPV macro
   needs a STRLEN variable. As the krb5 data structures only use some
   other type we simply copy the value to a locally defined STRLEN
   variable.
   (Christopher Odenbach)

1.905 2017-12-04T20:30:08Z
 - Make sure tests and author/release tests are run before making a release
   (Ioan Rogers)
 - Try to make sure we don't accidentally use features from a newer perl
   (Ioan Rogers)
 - use warnings; requires 5.6 but skip to 5.8 because 5.6 builds fail on
   travis and it's too old to care about (Ioan Rogers)
 - Have travis test all supported versions (Ioan Rogers)

1.904 2017-11-29T15:12:05Z
 - PAUSE error on last release. I only have permissions for Authen::Krb5,
   not Krb5, so try that (Ioan Rogers)
 - Add 'provides' to metadata (Ioan Rogers)
 - Add META.yml for older toolchains (Ioan Rogers)
 - Explicitly disable prototypes to shut up xsubpp (Ioan Rogers)
 - $VERSION is added by dzilla, don't declare it ourselves (Ioan Rogers)

   cpantesters (I hope) (Ioan Rogers)
 - Map some committers to their CPAN ids (Ioan Rogers)

 - Try `krb5-config` if pkgconf is unavailable (Ioan Rogers)
 - Only build against MIT kerberos, not compatable with Heimdal (Ioan
   Rogers)
 - [Closes rt#58960] fix POD spelling mistake (Ken Dreyer)
